# Dram.
You can view a demo of the app on my site at https://nick-t-hansen.github.io/

Dram. is an application that was developed to support aspiring and experienced whiskey collectors and tasters catalog their whiskey collection. As a fan of scotch, I know how difficult it is to be able to talk about whiskey. Everyone has varying experience in articulating flavors in whiskey which can be attributed to practice and palete. Dram. aims to create a more standard profile for novice and experienced alike to compare their reviews of whiskeys with others.

I created Dram. in C# using MVC Entity with Identity framework. I created a relational database with SSMS and SQL while using restful API practices to manipulate the user input data.


## Getting Started
1. clone repo using `git clone https://github.com/Nick-T-Hansen/Dram-Capstone.git`
2. open Virtual Studio and run Dram-Capstone
6. create a new account and login

## Version II Aspirations
1. Given a user wants to find a whiskey review based on a combination of flavors
    When the user searches the keywords in a search bar
    Then all items relevant to the search are filtered and displayed

1. Given a user likes a certain users reviews and wants to read reviews by that specific user
    When a user clicks on a button a review by that user
    then the user is followed
    and when the logged in user navigates to a following link in the nav bar
    then a list of users and their reviews are displayed
